# EBP Extension Proposals (EEPs)

This repository contains enhancement proposals for the Executable Book Project, similar to
[PEPs](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/) and also taking inspiration the way the [Jupyter project deals
with enhancement proposals](https://github.com/jupyter/enhancement-proposals).

The purpose is to publicly discuss new features & design choices in the EBP
ecosystem and to document the decision making process.
